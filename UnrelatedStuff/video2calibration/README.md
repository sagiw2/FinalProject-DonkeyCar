Camera Calibration Using OpenCV
===============================

Python scripts for camera intrinsic parameters calibration and image undistortion.

It finds following parameters:

  * focal length
  * principal point
  * radial distortion coefficients
  
using video of a moving chessboard pattern or a sequence of images as an input.

Example input: 

![input video](doc/input_video.jpg "Screenshot of an input video.")

Example output YAML file:

Installation
------------

Requirements:

  * numpy
  * PyYAML
  * OpenCV 3

Using pip the numpy and PyYAML can be installed as follows:
~~~
$ pip install < requirements.txt
~~~

Download and install [OpenCV 3.0 or newer](http://opencv.org/downloads.html). The python bindings have to be installed. If the OpenCV is not installed in the system, the python sys.path has to be set to point to cv2.so or cv2.pyd. It can be achieved by setting PYTHONPATH environment variable.

Camera Calibration
------------------

 1. print the pattern.png and glue it to a solid board
 3. fix the camera lens zoom, the calibration values change with the lens zoom changes
 2. record a video with the pattern moving in front of the camera
    * the pattern should be most of the time completely visible
    * try to move the pattern to cover all parts of the camera view, pay attention to the corners
    * the length of the video should be 1 or 2 minutes
 3. run the calibration.py to extract chessboard pattern corners from the video and perform camera calibration
 
Example usage (you can actually run the example, the input data is present in the ./example_input):

~~~
$ ./calibrate.py --help
usage: calibrate.py [-h] [--debug-dir DEBUG_DIR] [-c CORNERS] [-fs FRAMESTEP]
                    input out

Calibrate camera using a video of a chessboard or a sequence of images.

positional arguments:
  input                 input video file or glob mask
  out                   output calibration yaml file

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --debug-dir DEBUG_DIR
                        path to directory where images with detected
                        chessboard will be written
  -c CORNERS, --corners CORNERS
                        output corners file
  -fs FRAMESTEP, --framestep FRAMESTEP
                        use every nth frame in the video

Removing Radial Distortion
--------------------------

You can test the found radial distortion coefficients by removing distortion from an image and checking if straight lines are really straight.

~~~
$ ./undistort.py --help
usage: undistort.py [-h] calibration input_mask out

Undistort images based on camera calibration.

positional arguments:
  calibration  input video file
  input_mask   input mask
  out          output directory

optional arguments:
  -h, --help   show this help message and exit

$ ./undistort.py calibration.yaml 'example_input/*.png' out/
